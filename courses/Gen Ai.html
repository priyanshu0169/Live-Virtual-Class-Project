    <h1>What is generative AI?</h1>
    <h4>
Generative AI, also referred to as GenAI, allows users to input a variety of prompts to generate new content, such as text, images, videos, sounds, code, 3D designs, and other media. It “learns” and is trained on documents and artifacts that already exist online.
<br>

Generative AI evolves as it continues to train on more data. It operates on AI models and algorithms that are trained on large unlabeled data sets, which require complex math and lots of computing power to create. These data sets train the AI to predict outcomes in the same ways humans might act or create on their own.
